    <h2>AboutÂ MyÂ Journey</h2>
    <p>Hi there! Iâ€™m Aryan, the creator of Legal Career Hub. My curiosity about the law didnâ€™t come from a family of lawyers â€” it began in my living room, watching courtroom dramas like <em>TheÂ LincolnÂ Lawyer</em>, <em>LawÂ &Â Order</em> and <em>Suits</em>. I found myself captivated by the strategies attorneys used to argue their cases and the impact they had on peopleâ€™s lives. Those shows sparked a passion that has only grown stronger over the years.</p>
    <p>To explore that passion further, I enrolled in a preâ€‘law class at Harvard University. The course opened my eyes to the realâ€‘world demands of legal study and showed me that a legal career is within reach for students who are willing to work hard. Outside the classroom, I joined my schoolâ€™s mock trial team, where I learned how to craft arguments, deliver opening statements and think on my feet.</p>
    <p>Today, Iâ€™m a sophomore in Virginia who juggles school with a love of baseball and cars. When Iâ€™m not hitting the books or the field, Iâ€™m tinkering with engines and reading up on landmark court cases. I built this hub because I wanted other students to have a clear, honest guide to legal careers â€” the kind of resource I wished Iâ€™d had when I started exploring this field.</p>

        <h4>Building Legal Career Hub</h4>
        <p>Recognising a lack of comprehensive student resources, I designed this website to share what Iâ€™ve learned and to help others navigate their own journeys into law.</p>
