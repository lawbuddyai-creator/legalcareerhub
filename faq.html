    <h2>FrequentlyÂ AskedÂ Questions</h2>
    <p style="max-width:700px;margin:0 auto 2rem;text-align:center;">Below are answers to some of the most common questions aspiring law students ask. If you have a question that isnâ€™t covered here, feel free to use the suggestion box to let us know!</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Do I need to major in Political Science to go to law school?</summary>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>No. Law schools do not require or prefer a specific major. In fact, admissions committees value intellectual curiosity and critical skills over a particular field of study. A Harvard preâ€‘law guide notes that students can choose any major they enjoy â€” from history and political science to psychology, English, economics or philosophy â€” and still gain admission to law school. What matters most is developing strong problemâ€‘solving, reading, writing and communication skills during your undergraduate years.</p>

        <summary>How hard is the LSAT?</summary>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>The LSAT is challenging because it tests your ability to analyse complex arguments and think critically under time pressure. Most test takers score between 150 and 159, and the examâ€™s difficulty comes from intricate question types and strict timing. With thoughtful preparation and practice, however, you can improve your performance and feel more confident on test day.</p>

        <summary>Can I work while Iâ€™m in law school?</summary>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>It depends on your law schoolâ€™s policies and your personal capacity. Until 2014, the American Bar Association limited students to working 20Â hours per week, but that restriction has been lifted. Many law schools still discourage or prohibit employment during the first year due to the heavy academic load: fullâ€‘time students should expect to spend 36â€“48Â hours per week on classes and studying. Experts recommend delaying work until after first year and keeping hours to a minimum to protect your academic performance and wellbeing.</p>
