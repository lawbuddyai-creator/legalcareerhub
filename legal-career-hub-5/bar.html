    <h2>Bar Exam Basics</h2>
    <p>The bar examination is a professional licensure test that allows law graduates to practise in a specific jurisdiction. While each state sets its own requirements, most jurisdictions share several common elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legal education:</strong> Candidates must typically hold a Juris Doctor from an American Bar Association‑accredited law school.</li>
      <li><strong>Character &amp; fitness:</strong> Applicants undergo a character and fitness evaluation to ensure they meet professional standards of honesty and integrity.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethics exam:</strong> The Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam (MPRE) tests knowledge of professional conduct and is required in almost every state.</li>
      <li><strong>Exam schedule:</strong> Bar exams are administered twice a year – usually in February and July. Early registration is recommended to secure a seat and avoid late fees.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because admission rules vary by state, always consult your jurisdiction’s bar admissions office for definitive guidance.</p>

    <h2>Uniform Bar Exam vs Non‑UBE</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Uniform Bar Exam (UBE)</strong> is used by most U.S. jurisdictions. It comprises the Multistate Bar Exam (MBE), the Multistate Essay Exam (MEE) and the Multistate Performance Test (MPT). A key benefit of the UBE is portability: you can transfer your score to any participating jurisdiction, subject to that state’s passing‑score policy. <strong>Non‑UBE</strong> states, however, require their own bar exams and may include additional state‑specific components. Scores earned in these jurisdictions generally cannot be transferred elsewhere.</p>

    <h2>NextGen UBE (Starting July 2026)</h2>
    <p>The National Conference of Bar Examiners is rolling out a <em>NextGen Uniform Bar Exam</em> beginning in July 2026. This new exam will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Test a broad range of foundational lawyering skills through integrated question sets that blend multiple‑choice, short‑answer and performance tasks.</li>
      <li>Focus on a carefully selected set of legal concepts needed in today’s practice, balancing litigation and transactional skills.</li>
      <li>Continue to allow score portability among participating jurisdictions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first administration is scheduled for <strong>July 28–29, 2026</strong>. Scores will be reported on a 500–750 scale, with each jurisdiction setting its own passing score. To prepare, examinees can consult the official <em>Examinees’ Guide</em>, content scope outlines, sample questions and software preview provided by the NCBE.</p>
    <p>For detailed information and the latest updates, visit the <a href="https://www.ncbex.org/exams/nextgen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCBE NextGen UBE</a> page.</p>

    <h2>Preparation Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop a study schedule several months before your exam date and stick to it.</li>
      <li>Use official practice questions from the NCBE and reputable prep courses to familiarise yourself with exam format and timing.</li>
      <li>Take the MPRE early in your law school career to ensure you meet ethics requirements.</li>
      <li>Research your jurisdiction’s specific admission procedures, deadlines and any additional requirements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The bar exam is rigorous, but thorough preparation and an understanding of the requirements will help you succeed.</p>
