      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>Ever since I was young, I have been captivated by legal dramas and courtroom stories. Shows like <em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em>, <em>Law & Order</em> and other courtroom dramas sparked my curiosity about how lawyers strategise and how the justice system works. That fascination led me to enrol in a pre‑law class at Harvard University, where I gained first‑hand exposure to legal reasoning and case analysis. I’m currently a sophomore in Virginia balancing my academic interests with a love of baseball and cars. This project is my way of combining those passions — using storytelling, research and design to inspire other students to explore law and to demystify the path to becoming a lawyer. I hope that by sharing resources, success stories and my own experiences, I can help others find their place in the legal world.</p>
