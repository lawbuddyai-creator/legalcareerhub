    <h2>Law School Application Timing</h2>
    <p>Applying to law school is a marathon, not a sprint. Admissions experts note that there is no substantive difference between submitting your application on the first day it opens and within the first few weeks, but timing can still influence outcomes. Submitting by the end of October provides a strategic advantage, while applications received in November are still considered early. Applications submitted by the end of the calendar year are generally regarded as “on time.”</p>
    <p>Focus on preparing a thoughtful, complete application rather than rushing to submit on the very first day. Use the timeline below as a guideline and adjust based on your personal schedule.</p>

    <h2>Sample Application Opening Dates</h2>
    <p>Many law schools open their applications in late summer or early autumn. Here are approximate opening dates for several well‑known programs (verify exact dates each year):</p>
    <div class="table-wrapper">
      <table class="info-table">
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Law School</th><th>Approximate Opening Date</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Harvard Law School</td><td>Mid‑September (around Sept 15)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Columbia Law School</td><td>Early September (around Sept 1)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>University of Virginia School of Law</td><td>Early September (around Sept 1)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>University of Michigan Law School</td><td>Late August (around Aug 31)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Stanford Law School</td><td>Early September (around Sept 1)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>New York University School of Law</td><td>Early September (around Sept 1)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>University of Chicago Law School</td><td>Mid‑September</td></tr>

    <h2>Application Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an account with the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) and register for the Credential Assembly Service (CAS).</li>
      <li>Take or schedule the LSAT (or GRE if accepted by your target schools) and arrange for your scores to be sent to LSAC.</li>
      <li>Request transcripts from all undergraduate institutions and submit them through CAS.</li>
      <li>Draft a compelling personal statement that reflects your experiences and motivations for studying law.</li>
      <li>Update your résumé to highlight academic achievements, work experience and extracurricular involvement.</li>
      <li>Ask for letters of recommendation well in advance so your recommenders have time to write and submit them.</li>
      <li>Prepare any required addenda (e.g., GPA explanations or character disclosures) and optional diversity statements.</li>
      <li>Review each application carefully and submit it well before the final deadline, aiming for early fall where possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The law school application process can be intensive, but organized preparation and early planning will help you put your best foot forward.</p>
